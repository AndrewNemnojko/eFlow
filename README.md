<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The project aims to automate the updating of bouquet prices and availability on our company's website. Currently, this process is manual and consumes dozens of person-hours monthly. The main issue is the lack of detailed information about each flower in the bouquet               (quantity and price), hindering data updates and requiring manual recalculation by employees.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to address this by linking flower to bouquet . This will automate the updating of bouquet prices and availability based on the costs and quantities of flowers included. The system will also ensure inventory control by verifying if sufficient              flowers are available in stock to assemble specific bouquets. This approach will significantly speed up data updates and enhance accuracy.

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerated update process, enabling real-time data updates.</li>
            <li>Increased capacity for updates, maintaining an up-to-date catalog.</li>
            <li>Reduced errors associated with manual data input.</li>
            <li>Liberated employee time for other critical tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technological Stack</h2>
        <p>
            This project utilizes an ASP.NET API for backend development with JWT authentication and role-based access controls.
